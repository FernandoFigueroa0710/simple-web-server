# simple-web-server
A simple website server using basic NodeJS and scaling into serving HTML pages and CSS/Bootstrap. Utilizing the basic library that
comes with NodeJs such as `http`, `url`, `path` and `fs`. 

Although the HTML5 portion of this server isn't very efficient, the purpose of this excercise / tutorial is to demonstrate the power of
NodeJS and how to serve HTML pages into the browser. 

Also there has been included the bootstrap library into the CSS file. That is also being served by NodeJs in the browser. 

## What I learned : 
* Building a simple server without 3rd party modules
* Decribe the mime types in order for Node to accept the HTML and serve it 
* Implementation of the function `createServer` effectively in order to serve HTML pages 

## Technologies I used: 
* HTML5 
* CSS / Bottstrap v3.3.6
* Node 11.9.0

## How to use: 
* Fork this repo
* Clone repo to you local 
* Access project folder 
* inside the project run `npm run start`
* Go to your browser `http://localhost:3000`
